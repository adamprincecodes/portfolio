            My name is Adam Prince, I’m 19 years old and graduated from high school last year.
           I’ve always loved football because it challenges me and keeps me motivated.
           I’m someone who truly values honesty and respect, and I try to treat everyone
           the way I want to be treated. I’m hardworking, patient, and self-driven, and I don’t
           give up easily when I set my mind to something. I’m focused on building a strong
           future for myself, and I’m determined to keep growing, improving, and pushing 
           toward my goals.I am doing a course at <strong>GOMYCODE KENYA</strong> in Nairobi on <B>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.</B>
